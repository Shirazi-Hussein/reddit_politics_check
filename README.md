# About
With politics and partisan issues being a hotspot for both news and social media alike, I created an app that takes any reddit thread and returns a graph of how many commenters 
lean towards a specific demographic ("right-leaning", "left-leaning", and "not determined"). I feel like having total transparency with the insivisble bias that are hosted in every 
news thread is productive to help open up views on either side, and moreso create a healthier atmosphere for argument.
